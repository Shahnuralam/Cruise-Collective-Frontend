                                        No Party shall be in breach of this Agreement nor liable for delay in
                                        performing, or failure to perform, any of its obligations under this
                                        Agreement if such delay or failure result from events, circumstances
                                        or causes beyond its reasonable control. In such circumstances the
                                        time for performance shall be extended by a period equivalent to the
                                        period during which performance of the obligation has been delayed
                                        or failed to be performed. If the period of delay or non-performance
                                        continues for twenty (20) Working Days, the Party not affected may
                                        terminate this Agreement by giving twenty (20) Working Days written
                                        notice.
